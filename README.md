# COVID-19-Analysis-project
<b>This Repository is part of Short-Term Course on COVID19 Data Analysis from 15-29 July 2020 by IEEE JECRC STUDENT CHAPTER (STB11410).</b><br>
The analysis was performed with Python one of the most approachable languages for Machine learning users.<br>
In this course we have some assignments, 2 minor projects and major project.<br>
 
 <b>Assignment 1:-</b><br>
      Program for detecting symptoms of COVID-19 in a person. By asking questions according to there symptoms.<br>
 <b>Assignment 2:-</b><br>
      Script to Calculate Crude Mortality Rate (CMR) and Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) in respect to covid for all States of India.<br>
 <b>Assignment 3:-</b><br>
      Import dataset of Covid-19 state and calculate correlation between patients recovered and death ratio of state =“Kerala”.<br>
      By using regression find the relationship between cured/confirmed and deaths/confirmed.<br>
      Visualize with the help of a heat map ,the relationship between cured/confirmed/deaths taking the data of any 3 states of India.<br>
 <b>Minor Project 1:-</b><br>
      PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br>
      The chief minister of the UTTAR PRADESH is wanting to have a detailed overview of COVID 19 in the state vis-à-vis the neighbouring states for the month of June 2020 to plan       the strategy for safeguarding the people of the state. <br> 
      ▪ Create data frames for allocated state for the month of June 2020 on ▪ Confirmed ▪ Recovered ▪ Deaths (Date wise data of State and the districts data of that state)<br>
      ▪ Select the best of the plot(s) to represent the variability and trend<br> 
      ▪ Create a slide of plots  <br>
 <b>Minor Project 2:-</b><br>
      Pandemic Analyzer Calculator with GUI using python module tkinter which provides confirmed , active, recovered, deceased cases of selected State with its total population.
      calculates CMR AND IFR values also.<br>
 <b>Major Project:-</b><br>
      PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br>
      WHO has hired you for working on the dataset of COVID 19. Aggregate data and within TWO days present your point of view to the joint committee on strategic planning to fight       against COVID 19 on<br>
      A. Present state analytics – Uttarpradesh<br>
      B. Correlation heatmap for various parameters<br>
      C. Build a model for predicting the confirmed and recovered on any dates past 15th July 2020<br>
      D. Build a classifier for severity gauging<br>
